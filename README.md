<h1>Hello There Little One</h1>
<h6>Despite the fact that I am probably shorter than you.</h6>
<h3>Allow Me to Introduce Myself,</h3>
<p>
Hi there. I'm Modern_XP.<br>
I'm bad at spelling and programming, but one of those<br>
is my hobby and the other is spelling.<br>
<br>
I'm just here to have fun and make things for <b><i>k n o w l e d g e</i></b>.<br>
If you want to use anything on here, feel free. It's probably crap<br>
but at least it's something. If you use any of my projects, just be<br>
sure to mention me or something, although I'm not too<br>
concerned about that. You can just up and steal my stuff you<br>
ass, but I suppose it'd be nice to have a little recognition.<br>
<br>
I'm currently working on a Marching Cubes project.<br>
Figuring out how to do that has been fun.
</p>
<!--- <h3>Means of Contact</h3>

If you need to contact me for whatever reason, my <em>email</em> is <b>Modern.XP@outlook.com</b>.<br>
I'm not into the habit of checking my emails yet, so
feel free to yell at me on <em>Twitter</em> <b>@XPModern</b>.<br>
