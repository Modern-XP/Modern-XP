<h1>Howdy there fellow gamers</h1>

I'm Modern_XP.<br>
I'm bad at spelling and programming, but one of those<br>
is my hobby and the other is spelling.<br>
<br>
I'm just here to have fun and make things for <b><i>k n o w l e d g e</i></b>.<br>

Essentially, just credit me for my work if you use it.<br>
<br>
I'm currently working on learning more C++ and C#.<br>
Figuring out how to do that has been fun.
